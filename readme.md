# IMDb Movie Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze IMDb movie data to extract meaningful insights and trends. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and possibly building predictive models based on the data.

## Project Structure
- `IMdb.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, visualizations, and any model training.
- `dataset.csv`: Containing the dataset used for the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of IMDb movie data, including features such as movie titles, genres, release dates, ratings, and other relevant attributes.

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into several key sections:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the dataset to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Visualizations**: Creating visual representations of the data to better understand relationships and distributions.
4. **Modeling (if applicable)**: Applying machine learning models to predict movie ratings or classify movies into genres.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (if using machine learning models)

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
